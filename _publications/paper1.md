title: "FC-EODR: Immersive humanoid dual-arm dexterous explosive ordnance disposal robot"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper1
excerpt: 'In this study, we proposes a humanoid dual-arm explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) robot design. First, a seven-degree-of-freedom high-performance collaborative and flexible manipulator is developed, aiming at the transfer and dexterous operation of dangerous objects in EOD tasks. Furthermore, an immersive operated humanoid dual-arm dexterous explosive disposal robot (FC-EODR) is designed, which has a high passability to complex terrains such as low walls, slope roads, and stairs. It can remotely detect, manipulate, and remove explosives in dangerous environments through immersive velocity teleoperation. In addition, an autonomous tool-changing system is constructed, which enables the robot to flexibly switch between different tasks. The effectiveness of the FC-EODR is finally verified through a series of experiments, including the platform performance test, manipulator load test, teleoperated wire trimming, and screw-screwing experiments. This letter provides the technical foundation for robots to replace humans in EOD tasks and emergency situations.'
