title: "BIT-DMR: A Humanoid Dual-Arm Mobile Robot for Complex Rescue Operations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper2
excerpt: 'Using robots to assist or even replace rescuers for searching and rescuing has always been a research hotspot. Robots that can carry out dexterous operations at the scene are of great significance to reduce the life threat of rescue workers. Aiming at the characteristics of narrow space and frequent physical interaction in rescue scene, a dual-arm mobile robot BIT-DMR composed of humanoid upper body and tracked mobile platform is developed in this letter. The main work is as follows: a) A high-performance lightweight and heavy payload human-machine cooperative manipulator is developed, which has a slender shape and a large flexible workspace, improving the operation ability of the robot in complex rescue environment. b) A highly integrated tracked mobile platform is developed, which can change a variety of forms leading to a high trafficability in complex terrain. The flexibility of BIT-DMR to carry out rescue operation is verified by a series of experiments like payload testing, mobile platform performance, obstacle removing, door opening and casualty rescuing. This letter provides technical reserves for robots to assist or replace human beings to carry out rescue operations at the scene.'
