title: "Design and Implementation of Autonomous Navigation System Based on Tracked Mobile Robot"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper6
excerpt: 'In this paper, we introduce an autonomous exploration and rescue robot system based on a tracked mobile robot platform equipped with a 7 degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulator, which realizes autonomous navigation in indoor environments and autonomous stair climbing for safe and efficient search and rescue tasks. In Sect. 2, the hardware design of the robot system is presented, which allows flexible movement and high passability to complete obstacle crossing and stair climbing. In Sects. 3 and 4, the indoor navigation algorithm and the stair detection algorithm of the robot system are presented, respectively. The ROS-based system uses the cartographer algorithm for map construction, ROS navigation for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, and a depth camera for stair detection. The process of a four-flipper tracked mobile robot stair climbing is designed. The robot system is experimentally verified in Sect. 5.'
